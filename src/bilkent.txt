Bilkent University - the first private, nonprofit university in Turkey -
was founded on October 20, 1984, by Professor Ihsan Dogramaci, M.D., with 
the fundamental aim of creating a center of excellence in higher education 
and research. The name 'Bilkent' exemplifies this aim, since it is an acronym 
of 'bilim kenti': Turkish for 'city of learning and science.' The University 
campus is located off the main highway to Eskisehir about 12 km. (10 miles) 
west of the center of Ankara, and covers an area of more than 300 hectares.
